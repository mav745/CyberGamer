							From the makers of Half-Life comes Valve's Team Fortress, the ultimate team-based online action game.  With Team Fortress, you'll experience the thrill of battle while working as a member of a team, just like in real-world combat.  
							<p>
							Just log on, join a team and choose your role or "class." Because there are nine different classes, each with its own goals, methods and weapons, players can choose the one that best fits his or her style and skills. Are you one to charge into the fray, guns blazing?  Infantry is your class.  Perhaps you'd prefer the solitary, shadow-dwelling existence of the Sniper.  Or, if you're more into strategy than firepower, jump into the shoes of an Engineer or even the team Commander.  Whatever role you choose, you'll be a valuable member of a well-oiled machine, working together to complete the mission's objectives and defeat the other team.
							<p>
							<a href="apc.html"><img src="img/apc.jpg" width=214 height=164 border=1 alt="Armoured Personnel Carrier" align="left"></a>
							Mission objectives range from traditional Capture-the-Flag styles of play to spy scenarios and beyond, including complex missions similar to those found in real-time strategy games.
							<p>
							Team Fortress builds on all of the technology advancements that first appeared in Half-Life.  For example, while Half-Life was the first game to use skeletal animation for realistic character movement, Team Fortress pushes the envelope even further with Parametric Animation. This technology gives characters completely lifelike moves, such as heads that turn in the direction they are looking and leg strides that adjust depending on stance and condition.   
							<p>
							With its advanced technology, challenging teamplay scenarios, and ease of use, Team Fortress sets a new bar in multiplayer action gaming.
